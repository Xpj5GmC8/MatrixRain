# Matrix Rain

This is my own implementation of the matrix rain animation that's displayed on the terminal.
The program can also adapt to the terminal window being resized.

Written in C++.<br/>
Tested with compilers: GCC.<br/>
Operating systems supported: Linux.<br/>
Dependencies: none.<br/>
Comes with no warranty.<br/>

On my TODO list:
- Make the program use kana letters
- Make it more customizeable (custom colors, custom letters, etc.)
